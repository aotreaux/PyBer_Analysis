# PyBer_Analysis

Overview

The main goal of this analysis was to summarize and properly structure a Date Frame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Next we were tasked with creating a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

Results

As indicated by the DataFrame, you can see that the people within urban cities utilized ride sharing far more than suburban or rural areas. As a result the revenue generated within urban areas exceeded the other two areas. In adition, the average fare within urban areas was less than the others due to ther proxmity to higher populated areas which leads to shorter ride times/distances.

Judging from the Total Fare by City Type chart we can see that there is a decrease in activity leading up to the month of March for each city type.

Recommendations

1.  Increase fare for the urban areas as that is the where the majority of business is generated.
2.  Grow business in the suburban and rural areas by giving disocunts to first time drivers.
3.  Understand what is driving the peaks in the total fares generated and plan to add more services around those understandings.
